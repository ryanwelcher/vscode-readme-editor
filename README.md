# WordPress Playground markdown editor.

I hate writing in markdown. It's awkward. What if you have the option to use the WordPress block editor instead to take advantage of all of the tools it provides?

Well, now you do!

Inspired by [Dennis Snell's talk at WCUS 2024](https://www.youtube.com/live/Os6TC6-drsM?feature=shared&t=11310), I created this VSCode extension that allows you to edit your markdown files directly in the block editor.
